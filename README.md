# Simple_Projects
Various simple projects used for school or personal uses that aren't really useful to anyone besides myself.

### SortingSpeeds 
Sorts csv records with BubbleSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, SelectionSort, and ShellSort. Then compares the speeds.

### AnnualSalesTracker
Enter sales by month an get some basic annual statistics (Annual, Average, Highest Month, Highest Sales, Lowest Month, Lowest Sales).

### KidsGreen2
Got tired of filling out a long Questionare 5 days a week for 3 kids just to say, "No, they don't have covid." So I build a web automated program to:
  -open the web
  -fill all of them out
  -save the green pass image
  -crop it
  -then save it on my cloud drive for mobile access.

### Workload Calculator
Calculator that takes number of cases and number of workers to tell me how much time it will take for my team to finish for the day.
