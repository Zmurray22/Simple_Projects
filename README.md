### KidsGreen2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got tired of filling out a long Questionare 5 days a week for 3 kids just to say, "No, they don't have covid." So I built a web automated program to:<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-open the web<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-fill all of them out<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-save the green pass image<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-crop it<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-then save it on my cloud drive for mobile access.<br/>
